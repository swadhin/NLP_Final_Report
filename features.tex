\section{Features}
\label{sec:features}
We will use three different groups of features to help improve sarcasm detection accuracy, including lexical features, syntactic features, and social features. Table \ref{tab:lexical features} shows the lexical features we used in our experiments. Lexical features mainly capture lexical patterns of tweets, such as common word usage, phrases, etc. Syntactic features illustrated in Table \ref{tab:syn features} represent syntactic structures of tweets, such as the simple SVO pattern, etc. We exploit social features listed in Table \ref{tab:social features} to characterize dependencies across tweets. For example, tweets with similar named entities tend to have same sentiments.

negative or neutral. The online machine learning\\
framework Datumbox\cite{datumbox} is used to analyze sentiment.)}\\
