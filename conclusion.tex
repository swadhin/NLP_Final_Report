\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
The discussed paper proposes a knn-classifier like semi-supervised algorithm based on limited pattern and punctuation based features which achieve only F-measure of 0.54 in a limited Twitter dataset. In this project, we will initially attempt to collect the reasonable amount of sarcastic tweets for the evaluation purpose. Later, we will try to see the effect of different context information of recognizing the underlying saracasm of different tweets using different machine learning techniques.
