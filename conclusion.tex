\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this project, we have collected and consolidated a reasonable amount of sarcastic tweets for the evaluation purpose. We have also shown that if we include different socio-contextual feature with lexiacal and syntactic feature which basically represents world knowledge, we can achieve better accuracy in sarcasm prediction. There is also inherent variety of sarcastic tweets which needs to be tackled differently for better prediction. Using different supervised machine learning techniques, with these diverse set of features, we have shown to achieve better F1-score compared to different state-of-the-art techniques which mainly rely on syntactic and semantic features.
